## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project I recapped basic state management with ReactJs and conditional rendering according to that state.
Styling was made in plain CSS, with no need of pre-processors or frameworks.

### Continued development

I plan on keep developing challenges that involve basic state management to eventually go to a medium state management project.
